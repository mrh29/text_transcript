# Text Transcript

This repository gives a simple file to generate a transcript
of text conversations from an Apple chat database. You will
need to download the sqlite3 amalgamation and header file
for this project to compile.

## Database Locations

If you have an unencrypted backup of your phone, there is a database
is located at:

`~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/3d/3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28`

I would recommend copying this to a new location and renaming it to something more readable.

Alternatively you can use the database from the iMessage Application located at:

`~/Library/Messages/chat.db`
